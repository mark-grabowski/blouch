# BLOUCH

Bayesian Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models for Comparative Hypotheses
(BLOUCH) fits adaptive models of continuous trait evolution in a
Bayesian framework based on categorical or continuous predictors, and
incorporates measurement error following the approach of Hansen et
al. (2008). Blouch can also make phylogenetically informed predictions
of known or unknown traits from any clade, given a dataset of
comparative measurements and a phylogeny including the taxa of interest.

Blouch is a Bayesian version of its frequentist brother, Slouch
(Kopperud et al. 2020), which is available
<a href="https://github.com/kopperud/slouch" title="here.">here</a>.
While the front-end component of Blouch is written in R (R Core Team,
2015), the nuts and bolts are written in the language Stan (Carpenter et
al., 2017), which allows estimation of Bayesian models using Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on the Hamilton Monte Carlo
sampler.

## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with blouch I recommend starting with
the tutorial vignettes available on the package website. Blouch is based
on an article currently in review:

- Grabowski, M (in review). Bayesian Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models
  for Comparative Hypotheses (BLOUCH).

## Instalation Instructions

To install the R and Stan functions associated with Blouch from github,
first install the package devtools:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
#library(devtools)
```

Then install blouch

``` r
#devtools::install_github("mark-grabowski/blouch")
#library(blouch)
```
